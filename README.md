# 🌐 React Routing Website

Welcome to the **React Routing Website**! 🚀 This project demonstrates how to implement client-side routing in a React application using [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/). It’s perfect for learning how to build multi-page Single Page Applications (SPAs) without full page reloads.

## 📦 Features

- 🔹 **Client-Side Routing** – Navigate between pages without refreshing the browser  
- 🔹 **Dynamic Routing** – Render components based on URL parameters  
- 🔹 **Nested Routes** – Organize your app into nested views  
- 🔹 **React Router Hooks** – Use `useNavigate`, `useParams`, and `useLocation`
